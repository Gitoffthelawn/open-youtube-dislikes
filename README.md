    Open YouTube Dislikes
</h1>

Open YouTube Dislikes is a browser extension created to restore the recently removed dislike functionality to all YouTube videos. 

## Download

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/open-youtube-dislikes/"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ihUptG8.png" alt="Get Open YouTube Dislikes for Firefox"></a> 

## How?

It accomplishes this in a twofold manner: firstly by leveraging the >1.2B video dataset made available by the archive.org team [YouTube Dislikes](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam_youtubedislikes) (❤️), and secondly by estimating dislikes for any unknown videos via machine learning.


## Backend

The extension is powered by a Go backend which can be found here [dkgv/open-youtube-dislikes-backend](https://github.com/dkgv/open-youtube-dislikes-backend).
