# open-youtube-dislikes

Open YouTube Dislikes is a browser extension created to return dislikes to YouTube videos. It accomplishes this in a twofold manner: firstly by leveraging the >1.2B video dataset made available by the archive.org team [YouTube Dislikes](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam_youtubedislikes) (❤️), and secondly by estimating dislikes for any unknown videos via machine learning.

## Backend
The extension is powered by a Go backend which can be found here [dkgv/open-youtube-dislikes-backend](https://github.com/dkgv/open-youtube-dislikes-backend).
